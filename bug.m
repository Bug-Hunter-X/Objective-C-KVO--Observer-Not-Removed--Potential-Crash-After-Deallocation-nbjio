This code exhibits an uncommon Objective-C bug related to the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  Specifically, it demonstrates a scenario where an observer is not removed properly, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior after the observed object is deallocated.

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
        NSObject *observer = [[NSObject alloc] init];

        // Observe the myString property
        [obj addObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"myString" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:nil];

        // Set the observed property
        obj.myString = @"Hello";

        // Release the observed object prematurely without removing the observer
        [obj release]; 
        //Note: this is equivalent to obj = nil in ARC, but illustrative for the non-ARC context, which would be more likely to expose this kind of error
        obj = nil;

        // This line might cause an EXC_BAD_ACCESS or other unpredictable behavior, because observer is still pointing to deallocated obj
        //This will only trigger an error if the observer is still on the stack. If the observer is also deallocated, no error will occur, making debugging difficult
        [observer release];

    }
    return 0;
}
